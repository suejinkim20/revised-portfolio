# revised-portfolio
Ongoing work in project, this portfolio has been built using HTML and CSS.

## Description
This website has been created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

* Developer's name, recent photo are presented
* Links to sections about the developer, the developer's work, and how to contact the devloper are displayed in a navigation bar
* Navigation links scroll to corresponding sections
* The image for the first application is larger in size than the other application images
* Images for existing applications contain links to the deployed application
* Responsive layout adapts to the user's viewport when resized or viewed on various screens or devices


Issues that are still being addressed: 
* Continuing to experiment with the layout of the page to optimize responsive design
    * Specifically, making the heights/sizes of the portfolio images adjust flexibly in addition to the widths.

Notes to self:
* Include collaboration work (and other soft skills) with assistants/coaches/PLCs
* Need to consolidate verbiage on LinkedIn
* Add Coursera certifications
